## Start of project

I have started a REACT-project by installing it via Vite instead of create-react-app. Outside of Noroff's lessons I have done some research and read that Vite is more stable and functions quicker thatn create-react-app. On my last project I used create-react-app and it would quickly start to stop working, lag and work unreliably. Therefore I wanted to work with React using Vite this time to see for myself if it functions better for me. It has so far been more reliable, worked better and quicker, but also I have not experienced any lag or malfunctions with the dev preview. So for this project my experience was better using Vite than using create on the project prior to this one.
